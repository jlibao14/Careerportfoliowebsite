## Artifacts

### Portfolio Website (`artifacts/portfolio/`)
- **Type**: React + Vite SPA
- **Preview Path**: `/`
- **Port**: 21113
- **Subject**: John Michael L. Libao (Quezon City, Philippines)
- **Contact**: cs_info@agentmail.to | linkedin.com/in/jlibao14

#### Pages
- `/` — Home (hero, impact metrics, expertise areas, featured projects, CTAs)
- `/about` — About & Leadership Narrative (career timeline across 5 roles, leadership principles)
- `/portfolio` — Filterable project grid (filter: All, ERP, Cloud, Integration, Governance)
- `/portfolio/:id` — Dynamic Project Detail (problem, solution, tech stack, metrics, company, role)
- `/capabilities` — Capabilities deep-dive (ERP & Digital Transformation, DevOps & Software Engineering, Cloud & Infrastructure, Systems Integration & Architecture, IT Governance & Compliance). Live demos on this page support shareable session links via URL query params (`?demo=<slug>&state=<base64>#live-demos`). Sharing encodes the current localStorage state into a base64 payload; recipients see an import banner if they already have local state, or auto-load otherwise.
- `/contact` — Client-side contact form with validation

#### AI Chat Assistant
- Floating chat widget (`src/components/chat/ChatWidget.tsx`) mounted globally in `App.tsx`
- Streams responses from OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini) via the API server's `POST /api/chat` endpoint (SSE)
- Knowledge base lives in `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/knowledgeBase.ts` (system prompt with John's bio + project highlights, including a COMPLIANCE & FRAMEWORKS DEFINITIONS section that mirrors the on-site explainer cards so the chat answers and the UI badges agree on what each framework means in John's portfolio)
- Conversation is held in component state only (not persisted across page reloads)
- **Action-capable tools** — the model can propose four tools and the visitor confirms them inline via `ActionCard`:
  - `book_meeting` — emails recruiter + CCs John, attaches an .ics invite when the time parses.
  - `send_brief` — generates a tailored one-page PDF (`lib/briefPdf.ts`), emails the recruiter, and offers an in-chat download via `GET /api/chat/brief/preview`.
  - `alert_john` — sends a hot-lead alert to John and writes a row to `hot_leads`.
  - `share_with_panel` — emails 1–3 panellists with a curated pitch (top proof projects + brief link).
- Each action: validated server-side, rate-limited per IP (5/min, 30/day), audited in `chat_actions`, and surfaced in the admin dashboard's "Chat actions" + "Hot leads" cards. Nothing is sent until the visitor clicks Confirm.

### API Server (`artifacts/api-server/`)
- **Type**: Express 5 API
- **Preview Path**: `/api`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/contact` — Receives contact form submissions and sends email via AgentMail API to `cs_info@agentmail.to`
  - `POST /api/chat` — SSE-streaming chat endpoint. **Primary brain: AssistLoop.ai** (agent ID `ASSISTLOOP_AGENT_ID`, secret `ASSISTLOOP_API_KEY`). AssistLoop responds over a Pusher WebSocket channel (`assistloopClient.ts`); the server streams chunks to the client using a minimal tail-buffer (≤10 char holdback) to detect the action sentinel while preserving token-by-token streaming. Conversation continuity is maintained via a stable `chat_user_id` derived from the client IP + first message. **Fallback brain: OpenAI gpt-4o-mini** (Replit AI Integrations) — activated automatically if AssistLoop is unconfigured, if session creation fails, if the Pusher channel errors, or if no content arrives within the timeout. The fallback only fires when zero content has been sent (prevents mixed output). The four AI action tools (`book_meeting`, `send_brief`, `alert_john`, `share_with_panel`) work on **both** paths: the AssistLoop agent is instructed to append a `%%ACTION%%{...}%%` sentinel at the end of any action-proposing reply; the server strips the sentinel and emits the same `action_request` SSE event as the OpenAI `tool_calls` path. Topic classification, rate limits, and audit logging work regardless of which brain serves the response. `chat_logs.model` is set to `"assistloop"` or `"gpt-4o-mini"` accordingly.
  - `POST /api/chat/actions/{book_meeting|send_brief|alert_john|share_with_panel}` — confirmed-action endpoints. Validate the model's arguments, rate-limit per IP, send via AgentMail (CC `cs_info@agentmail.to`), and write an audit row to `chat_actions` (plus `hot_leads` for `alert_john`).
  - `GET /api/chat/brief/preview` — re-renders the tailored one-page PDF for in-chat download after `send_brief` succeeds.
  - `GET /api/admin/chat-actions` and `GET /api/admin/hot-leads` — admin-only audit endpoints feeding the new dashboard cards.
  - `POST /api/demo-events` — Records anonymous interaction telemetry from the Live Capability Demos. Body: `{ demo: "ticketing"|"erp"|"bi", event: "first_interaction"|"ticket_created"|"stock_adjusted"|"range_changed"|"export_clicked"|"project_link_clicked"|"invoice_generated" }`. No PII stored. Per-IP rate limited to 60 requests/minute via the durable Postgres limiter; soft-fails (HTTP 202) on DB errors so demos never break.
  - `GET /api/admin/demo-events?windowDays=N` — Admin-only summary (1–90 days, default 30) returning `{ windowDays, periodStart, periodEnd, byDemo: [{ demo, total, events: { ... } }], dailyByDemo: { [demo]: [{ day, count }] } }`. The `dailyByDemo` field provides a day-by-day interaction count per demo (zero-filled for the entire window). Surfaced in the AdminUsage dashboard as the "Live demos engagement" card with per-demo mini bar charts (recharts).
  - `GET /api/healthz` — Health check
- **Scheduled Jobs**:
  - **Weekly Digest** — durable scheduler (`digestScheduler.ts`) sends a usage digest email on a configurable weekday/hour cadence. State in `digest_schedule` table.
  - **Demo Events Purge** — lightweight scheduler (`demoPurge.ts`) runs every 24 hours and deletes `demo_events` rows older than 120 days. The dashboard only queries the last 90 days, so the 120-day retention window provides a comfortable buffer. Logs purge counts; errors are caught and retried on the next cycle.
- **Dependencies**:
  - AgentMail integration (API key stored in `AGENTMAIL_API_KEY` env var)
  - AssistLoop.ai (primary chat brain): `ASSISTLOOP_API_KEY` secret, `ASSISTLOOP_AGENT_ID` env var, `ASSISTLOOP_BASE_URL` env var. Uses `pusher-js` to subscribe to the private Pusher channel and collect AI response chunks in real time. Pusher app key and cluster are hard-coded to AssistLoop's production values but can be overridden via `ASSISTLOOP_PUSHER_KEY` / `ASSISTLOOP_PUSHER_CLUSTER`.
  - OpenAI via Replit AI Integrations (fallback chat brain): env: `AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_API_KEY`. Activated automatically when AssistLoop fails or is not configured.

## Key Commands

- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages
- `pnpm test` — run every workspace package's tests in one shot (alias for `pnpm -r --if-present run test`). The same command runs in the CI `test` job (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) on every push to `main` and on every pull request, alongside `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` and `pnpm run typecheck`. A separate `e2e` job in the same workflow installs Chromium (cached across runs) and runs `pnpm --filter @workspace/portfolio run test:e2e`, so both unit and e2e regressions are caught before merge. After every e2e run, an Allure report is generated with historical trend data from previous runs and deployed to GitHub Pages (main branch only). The raw Allure results are also uploaded as a CI artifact (7-day retention) for pull request runs. The historical Allure dashboard lives at `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/` and shows pass/fail trends, flaky test detection, and per-test duration graphs across builds.
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks from OpenAPI spec
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run API server locally
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run test` — run API server tests (node:test, no extra deps; covers chat route + SSE parser)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/portfolio run dev` — run portfolio locally
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/portfolio run test:e2e` — run Playwright e2e tests for the live demos on `/capabilities` (requires `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` pointing to the Chromium cache, and the dev server either running or launched by Playwright's `webServer` config). Produces both HTML and Allure results (in `allure-results/`)

## Branch Protection (GitHub)

The repository `gtotradingcorp-git/Hybrid-Interactive-Website-Portfolio` on GitHub is **public** and has a **repository ruleset** named "Protect main" (ID 15561483) that enforces merge requirements on the `main` branch:

- **Require a pull request before merging** — direct pushes to `main` are blocked.
- **Required status checks** — the CI workflow's `typecheck + test` and `e2e tests` checks (from `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) must pass before a PR can merge.
- **Strict status check policy** — branches must be up to date with `main` before merging, so checks always run against the latest code.
- **No bypass actors** — nobody can bypass these rules (`current_user_can_bypass: never`).

The ruleset is managed via the GitHub Rulesets API (Settings > Rules > Rulesets in the UI). View or edit it at: `https://github.com/gtotradingcorp-git/Hybrid-Interactive-Website-Portfolio/rules/15561483`

Anyone re-creating the repo (or a fork) needs to set up the ruleset again. Without it, GitHub will happily merge a PR even when CI is red.

## E2E Test Report History (Allure + GitHub Pages)

The CI `e2e` job generates an Allure report after every run (pass or fail) and deploys it to GitHub Pages on the `gh-pages` branch. Each deploy merges the previous report's history so the dashboard accumulates trend data across builds.

**GitHub Pages setup**: In the repo's Settings > Pages, set the source to "Deploy from a branch" and select the `gh-pages` branch / `/ (root)`. The `gh-pages` branch is created automatically on the first successful main-branch CI run by the `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` action.

The report URL is `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/` and provides:
- Pass/fail trend charts across builds
- Flaky test detection (tests that flip between pass and fail)
- Per-test duration graphs to spot performance regressions
- Drill-down into individual test results with traces and screenshots
